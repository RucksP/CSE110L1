enum Buttons
{
  PAD_BUTTON_LEFT = 0x0001,
  PAD_BUTTON_RIGHT = 0x0002,
  PAD_BUTTON_DOWN = 0x0004,
  PAD_BUTTON_UP = 0x0008,
  PAD_TRIGGER_Z = 0x0010,
  PAD_TRIGGER_R = 0x0020,
  PAD_TRIGGER_L = 0x0040,
  PAD_BUTTON_A = 0x0100,
  PAD_BUTTON_B = 0x0200,
  PAD_BUTTON_X = 0x0400,
  PAD_BUTTON_Y = 0x0800,
